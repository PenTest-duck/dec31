# dec31 — MANIFESTO

> **Design the person, not the plan.**

---

## 0. One‑Sentence Thesis

**dec31 is an AI‑native system for deliberately shaping human identity and behavior through small, compounding actions—so that who you are on Dec 31 is not accidental.**

It is not a productivity app.
It is behavioral infrastructure.

---

## 1. Core Philosophy

Humans do not rise to goals.
They fall to systems.

Motivation is unreliable.
Willpower is finite.
Behavior is predictable.

**dec31 exists to engineer systems that make the right behavior the default.**

---

## 2. Identity Is the Root Primitive

Tasks do not matter.
Habits do not matter.
Goals do not matter.

**Identity matters.**

Every action is a vote for the type of person the user is becoming.

The core loop:

```
Identity → Behavior → Evidence → Reinforced Identity
```

The product always speaks in identities, not tasks.

❌ “Did you complete the habit?”
✅ “Did this action support the identity you are becoming?”

---

## 3. Time Is the Spine

Dec 31 is not branding.
It is the psychological container.

Humans change best when time is:

* Finite
* Meaningful
* Emotionally charged

The user is always moving toward Dec 31.
Every action is contextualized by:

> “Is this consistent with the person who reaches Dec 31?”

---

## 4. Systems Beat Willpower

Failure is never moral.
Failure is diagnostic.

When behavior fails, the system is wrong.

The system adjusts by manipulating:

* Friction
* Defaults
* Cues
* Environment
* Action size

**The product never tells the user to try harder.**

---

## 5. Behavior Engineering Principles

### 5.1 Friction

* Reduce friction for desired behavior
* Increase friction for undesired behavior

### 5.2 Defaults

* Humans follow defaults
* Success should happen without thinking

### 5.3 Cues

* Behavior follows cues, not reminders
* Design cues, not notifications

### 5.4 Energy Awareness

* Energy fluctuates
* Expectations must adapt
* No shame for low‑energy days

---

## 6. The Role of AI

The AI is not:

* A cheerleader
* A boss
* A therapist
* A productivity influencer

The AI **is**:

### 6.1 A Mirror

Reflects behavioral patterns the user cannot see.

### 6.2 A Behavioral Scientist

Diagnoses why systems fail.

### 6.3 A Systems Designer

Proposes structural changes, not motivational speeches.

### 6.4 An Identity Reinforcer

Anchors progress to becoming, not output.

Tone rules:

* Calm
* Precise
* Minimal
* Slightly opinionated
* No hype

---

## 7. Minimalism Is Ethical

Cognitive overload prevents behavior change.

Rules:

* Few screens
* Few inputs
* Few metrics

If something can be inferred, **do not ask**.

Calm is a feature.

---

## 8. Failure Doctrine

There is no streak.
There is no falling off.

Only:

* Signal
* Diagnosis
* Adjustment

Failure increases system intelligence.

---

## 9. Social Engineering (Used Ethically)

Humans change faster when:

* They feel witnessed
* Their identity is socially reinforced

dec31 may use:

* Accountability
* Witnessing
* Narrative presence

Never manipulation.
Never shame.

---

## 10. Core Product Loop

```
Identity → Action → Vote → Reflection → System Adjustment
```

Daily interaction requirements:

* One identity
* One action
* One vote (Yes / No / Partial)
* Optional one‑line reflection

No dashboards by default.
No analytics obsession.

---

## 11. Onboarding Doctrine

Onboarding locks identity.

The user commits to:

* One identity
* One Dec 31 outcome

No tutorials.
No feature tours.

Commitment before convenience.

---

## 12. MVP Feature Boundaries

Hard cap:

1. Single active identity
2. AI‑generated daily action
3. Identity vote system
4. System debugging logic
5. Dec 31 trajectory narrative

Anything else is optional.
Most things are distractions.

---

## 13. The Dec 31 Moment

On Dec 31, the product produces **one artifact**:

A narrative of who the user became, with evidence.

Not stats.
Not charts.

A story that makes sense.

---

## 14. What dec31 Is Not

* Not hustle culture
* Not gamified productivity
* Not streak‑based habit tracking
* Not motivational content

If it induces anxiety, it is wrong.

---

## 15. The One Guiding Question

Every line of code must answer:

> **“Is this helping the user become someone—or just feel productive?”**

If the answer is unclear, do not ship.

---

**End Manifesto.**
